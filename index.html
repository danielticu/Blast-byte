				<h4>The problem </h4>
				<p>People have the need to be entertained for brief periods, wether on the subway, in the bus
					station, or at the restaurant while waiting for the order. There is the need for an entertaining
					game that can be played for just a few seconds or minutes and still progress. There are many
					available games which can do that but the average playing time is low and the global market is so
					big that there is still a big part of it ready for new products.</p>

				<h4>Our solution </h4>
				<p>A simple game which can entertain a user for a few minutes of his spare time. The game is divided
					into several levels with the same general purpose. It is made with no specific ending, each level
					being followed by a similar but harder one. The main difference from a more complex game is that a
					user can play it for a few seconds or a few minutes and still make progress.</p>

					entertainment activity. On one hand, our main competitors consist in equally complex games, from the
					same categories as us. On the other hand, we also compete against more complex games which users
					play on the long term. Last but not least, streaming services like Youtube and Netflix keep the
					users from playing our game.</p>

				<h4>The way that we identified the problem </h4>
				<p>
					Well, that's easy, it was a normal morning of November, far from these rough times. Me and Daniel
					were travelling to the university by the metro having a casual conversation as usual, when we
					noticed
					that, around us, there were many people who travel alone, bored and unhappy. Searching for some
					statistics about how people fill their travelling time or those short periods of free time, we
					observed that the majority of people are a little bit nostalgic about games that were most-played
					some years ago. Some of them moved to Social Media applications, however, we identified a problem
					here. Based on multiple research articles, depression and anxiety became a real threat for more and
					more people and these Social Media apps don't represent a solution for it. Moreover, some studies
					showed that in some cases simple entertaining games are more efficient than medical treatment.

				<h4>Solution for the problem </h4>
				<p>
					We'd like to launch an easy-to-play game that can be played wherever and whenever. Our project is
					designed to deliver not only entertainment and a way to spend your free time, but also a solution
					for depression and anxiety through multiple options to play, solo or with your friends. We also
					intend to include many leaderboard systems to enhance the competitivity and a reward mechanism, so
					that the users to feel appreciated.

				<h4>Customer discovery plan - overview </h4>
				<p>
					Our process for customer discovery involved many methods, but the most important two were the online
					questionnaire and interviews. In our study, we tried to engage people of various ages and different
					types of occupations.

				<h4>Customer discovery plan - detailed process </h4>
				<p>
					Firstly, we wanted to know what a highschool student thought about a mobile game and what were his
					habits when it came to spending free time, gaming, game aquisition and so on. Let's listen together
					what our confident and smart guy, Razvan, has to say.
				</p>

				<div class="row justify-content-center py-3 pb-5">
					<audio controls controlsList="nodownload" src="audio/interviu_razvan.mp3"></audio>
				</div>

				<p>
					Razvan is passionate about computer games, especially first person shooters. As for smartphone
					games,
					his personal favorite is Among Us because of the multiplayer side of the game. He admits that the
					multiplayer functionality and the competition with friends is the main motivation for playing. Also,
					when having a little spare time he often uses social media as a form of entertainment.
					<br><br>
					Moreover, in order to validate our idea, we decided to construct an online questionnaire with
					questions that
					will help us both establish a focus group and see the needs and habits of that group. The biggest
					amount of players are in the under 18 groups, but the ones that spend the most amount of money on a
					game are in the 18-25 range. This means that we will have to develop the right product to suit both
					categories. Almost all of the participants are playing games on a smartphone instead of a tablet and
					that showed us on what platform to focus on our application. <br><br>

					Almost 30% of the people interviewed admitted to having paid money for game items and bonuses, with
					the majority of them paying under 100 RON per month. Almost half of all the items that out subjects
					bought are valued between 10 and 25 RON, all the other price ranges having an equal distribution.
					All our respondents agree that limited offers and one-time deals are the best way to make them
					purchase an item in the game. <br><br>

					When asked about a game's advertising and which ads were the most effective in reaching them, almost
					half of the survey's subjects agreed that the most effective way of advertising a game is through
					friend's recommendations. Those games are also the ones that were played for the longest amount of
					time. Most of the subjects admitted that they are more likely to recommend a game to a friend based
					on the ability to play together and on the overall positive experience of the game than based on
					invitation rewards. <br><br>

					When asked why they come back and play the game one more time, a quarter of all the respondents
					answered that boredom is the number one factor in pulling out their smartphone and continuing the
					game. In the second place stand the daily rewards and missions which can be lost if a day is
					skipped. <br><br>

				<h4>Insights that have affected our product </h4>
				<p>
					We were happy to find out that the majority of people between the ages of 3 and 25, of both genders,
					are frequently playing some kind of smarpthone game. This is how we established our focus group.
					After interpreting the results we found out that most people emjoy simple and entertaining games and
					feel the need for a new game on the market. The main reason for playing a game is boredom and after
					a few days playing, people return to the game mainly for daily rewards.

					<br><br>
					We were happy to see that wen asked the name of a smartphone game, most of the respondents named a
					small game like Temple Run, Candy Crush or Among Us.

					<br><br>
					We realised that in order to promote a game, a good practice is to buy ads in other games, so that
					players will see another game while they are already playing.

					friends, the main two criteria which we chose to build this product for.

				<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
				<p>We received a total of 47 form subscriptions using Formspree. However, almost 20% were duplicated which means that

				<h4>What did we observe? </h4> <br>
				<p>Concerning the <b>heatmaps</b>, we had very good results on Smartphone and Tablet users, but we noticed some random clicking regarding PC users. 
				It was great that we included the subscription form in the upper part of the web page so that 100% of the users could see it. 
				We had two calls to action, the subscription form and the Google Play and App Store download buttons.
				As for the scrolling, we need to take into consideration shortening our webpage and making it more attractive in order 
				to make the users scroll all the way to the bottom. We had very good results with tablet users regarding the heatmaps, but 
				there were only 20 page views from tablets.</p>
				<p>For PC we had an average of <b>3.5 clicks per user</b>, for tablet we had about <b>1.1 clicks per user</b> and fot smartphone 
				<b>0.77 clicks per user</b>. This means that the PC users do a lot of random clicking on the page and a lot of the smartphone users 
				visit the site by accident.</p>

				<h4>Advertisment campaign conclusion </h4> <br>
				<p>It cost us <b>40 RON to get 173 people</b> on our landing page. About 10% of the users left the site in under 4 seconds 
				so we can conclude that they clicked the ad by accident. Also, another 20% of the users stayed on the page for mote than 1 minute, 
				which means that they left the browser tag open. According to Google Analytics, the average site visit was 13 seconds, 
				but after removing the lower and upper limits we obtained an average of 20 seconds</p>
				<p> All in all we gathered <b>34 subscriptions and 25 clicks on the download buttons</b>.</p>

				<h4>Minimum viable product </h4> <br>
				
				<p>We uploaded the game on <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZZWaTGaming.ByteBlast"> Google Play </a> 
				on the 29th of December and by the 2nd of January it was accepted and posted. 
				The game was rated as a PEGI 3 app, which means that the game is suitable for all ages by containing no violence, or explicit content.</p>
				
				<p>The first screen of the game is the dashboard. The player can then begin the game or enter the Options pannel in order to 
				toggle settings. When the game starts, a timer appears on the center of the screen along with a meteorite counter. 
				The counter represents the number of metrorites destroyed by the player. With the passing of the time the game gets more 
				difficult with more and more meteorites showing up on the screen. The game ends when 10 meteorites are on the screen. At the end 
				the player can view a video ad in order to double the score, this action can only be done once. </p>
				
				<p>As for the revenue streams, we are displaying a skippable video ad after every game and a non-skippable ad when the player
				chooses to double the score. In order to change the background and the meteorites, the player must buy new skins from the 
				Store section. In the MVP the players must view a non-skippable ad in order to obtain the skins. </p>
